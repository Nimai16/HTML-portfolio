   <p>Below, you'll be able to find some of my initial web development projects:</p>

   <h3><a href="./public/Anime-Ranking.html" draggable="true">Anime-Ranking project</a></h3>
   <img src=".//assets/images/Assets/Anime ranking img.png" alt="Project preview image" width="600" height="600">
<p>This was one of my first projects, at first, I made it really simple but with future classes I was able to improve it and I plan to keep doing it.</p>

   <h3><a href="./public/birthday-invite.html" draggable="true>">Birthday-invite project</a></h3>
   <img src=".//assets/images/Assets/Birthday inv img.png" alt="Project preview image" width="500" height="500">
<p>This was my second important project, I learned a lot about list nesting and indentation on this one.</p>

<!-- AI feedback

 **Here's my feedback and recommendations for your HTML portfolio code:**

**Structure and Content:**

- **Heading hierarchy:** Consider using a larger heading (like `h1`) for your name and title, and a smaller heading (like `h2`) for "I am a web developer" to create a stronger visual hierarchy.
- **Project descriptions:** Add brief descriptions or highlights under each project link to showcase their features and accomplishments, even for simple projects.
- **Image optimization:**
    - Use descriptive alt text for images, not just "Project image." Describe what the image shows for accessibility and SEO.
    - Optimize image sizes for faster loading. Large images can slow down the page.
- **Links:**
    - Remove the `draggable="true"` attribute from links unless you have a specific reason for making them draggable.

**Formatting and Styling:**

- **Indentation:** Ensure consistent indentation throughout the code for better readability.
- **Line breaks:** Add line breaks within paragraphs to improve readability.
- **Image alignment:** Consider aligning images to one side or using a grid layout for visual appeal.

**Additional Suggestions:**

- **Contact information:** Include your contact information (email, social media links) for easy connection.
- **Skills section:** List your primary web development skills to highlight your expertise.
- **Testimonials (optional):** If you have positive feedback from clients or peers, consider adding testimonials to boost credibility.
- **CSS styling:** While you're not required to use CSS, even basic styling can significantly enhance the visual appeal and organization of your portfolio.

**Overall:**

Your HTML code provides a good foundation for a simple portfolio website. Implementing these suggestions will improve its clarity, informativeness, and visual appeal. As you continue learning and building more projects, you can iteratively enhance your portfolio to showcase your growing skills and experience effectively! -->
