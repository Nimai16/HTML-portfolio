<!-- Feedback and Recommendations for your HTML code:
Structure and Content:

Greeting: Consider adding a personal greeting before "It's my birthday!" to make it more welcoming.
Date: Specify the year along with the day and month in "On the 16th July." (e.g., "On the 16th July, 2024").
Image source: Replace the "Example image URL" comment with the actual image URL.
Gift preferences: Instead of "Una coquita," briefly explain what "coquita" is for non-familiar guests. Consider phrasing it as "Bring your favorite coquita to share!" for clarity.
Cats with snacks?: The nested list under "Gatos" might be confusing. Clarify if guests should bring cats that like these snacks as a joke or if the snacks are for the host's cats.
Map description: Add a brief description of the location beyond just "This is where you need to go." (e.g., "Come celebrate at my place! Here's the map.")
Technical Recommendations:

Image accessibility: Add an alt text attribute to the nested list items under "Gatos" to inform screen readers about the snack options.
Image optimization: Optimize the birthday cake image for faster loading.
Validate your code: Use online HTML validators to ensure code cleanliness and compatibility across browsers.
Additional suggestions:

Consider adding RSVP information if you want guests to confirm their attendance.
You can further personalize the invitation by including a fun fact about yourself or a birthday wish.
Overall:

Your HTML code is a good start for a birthday invitation! Implement these suggestions to improve clarity, add details, and ensure accessibility for all guests. Have fun celebrating your birthday!
