<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Nimai Canizales, Senior engineer at Microsoft for the Azure AD department</p>

<p>I have vast experience in the cloud, specifically on the Azure cloud, however, I al deeply interested in the whole development area and currently working my way into it as a self learner.</p>

<p>I also have experience in networking, specifically, Cisco. I took the cisco CCNA course, and even though I did not go the networking route, that helped me a lot to understand how pretty much everything in the internet works.</p>
